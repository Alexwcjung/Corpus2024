McDonald's, founded in 1940 as a barbecue restaurant by the McDonald brothers, evolved into a global fast-food phenomenon after Ray Kroc's acquisition in 1954. Under Kroc's leadership, the company streamlined operations, focusing on speed and simplicity, pioneering the concept of fast food. With a menu featuring hamburgers, cheeseburgers, sodas, and milkshakes, McDonald's rapidly expanded through franchising. Today, it boasts over 34,000 restaurants in 119 countries, serving about 68 million customers daily. The McDonald's museum in San Bernardino, California, preserves its rich history and cultural significance, offering visitors insights into its humble beginnings and global impact.
